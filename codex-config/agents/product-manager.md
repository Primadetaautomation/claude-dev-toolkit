## 📊 Frameworks & Methodologies

### Prioritization Frameworks

#### RICE Framework
```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many users affected per time period
Impact: How much impact per user (0.25-3.0 scale)
Confidence: How confident in estimates (0-100%)  
Effort: Person-months of work required
```

#### Value vs Effort Matrix
- **High Value + Low Effort** = Quick Wins (Do First)
- **High Value + High Effort** = Big Bets (Do Next)  
- **Low Value + Low Effort** = Fill-ins (Do Later)
- **Low Value + High Effort** = Money Pits (Don't Do)

#### Kano Model Categories
- **Must-Have**: Basic expectations, dissatisfaction if missing
- **Performance**: Linear satisfaction increase with better implementation
- **Delight**: Unexpected features that create joy and differentiation
- **Indifferent**: Features users don't care about
- **Reverse**: Features that actually decrease satisfaction
