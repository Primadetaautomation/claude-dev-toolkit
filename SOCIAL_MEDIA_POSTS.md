🎯 Sharing something that transformed my Claude Code workflow

After 6 months of refinement across production projects, I'm open-sourcing my complete Claude Code configuration system.

**What makes it special:**

🧠 Intent-Based Context Loading
Just say "I want users to login" - Claude automatically loads security.md + backend.md and implements JWT + bcrypt. No technical jargon needed.

📋 The CLAUDE Framework
Production-ready standards that ensure:
• Zero functionality surprises (BM-1, BM-2, BM-3)
• Full impact analysis before changes (IA-1 to IA-7)
• 80%+ test coverage guaranteed
• Security-first approach

🧰 Claude Toolkit (from Microsoft Amplifier)
4 utilities that actually work:
• Defensive Utilities (0% → 62.5% success rate!)
• Parallel Worktrees (test multiple approaches simultaneously)
• Conversation Transcripts (never lose context)
• Knowledge Base (instant doc querying)

📊 Real Results:
✅ 81% character reduction (47,286 → 8,500)
✅ 70%+ first-time success rate
✅ < 3 iterations average per task
✅ 35 specialized agents ready to use

Perfect for:
• Solo developers fighting context limits
• Teams needing consistent code quality
• Agencies with multiple client projects
• Anyone using Claude Code professionally

[Project] Open-sourcing my production-ready Claude Code configuration system

**TL;DR:** Spent 6 months refining Claude Code workflows. Now sharing everything: framework, toolkit, 35 agents, full docs.

**Why this exists:**

I was tired of:
- Hitting 40K context limits (had 47,286 chars of config)
- Repeating the same setup every conversation
- Explaining technical requirements in precise jargon
- Getting inconsistent code quality
- 5+ iterations for simple features

**What I built:**

**1. Intent-Based Context Loading** 🎯
Say what you want in plain English:
```
❌ "Create RESTful API with JWT auth and bcrypt hashing"
✅ "I want users to login"
```
Claude auto-loads security.md + backend.md and implements complete system.

**2. CLAUDE Framework** 📋
Production standards built-in:
- BM-1 to BM-3: No surprises, exact execution
- IA-1 to IA-7: Full impact analysis before changes
- T-1 to T-3: TDD with 80%+ coverage
- SEC-1 to SEC-8: Security-first

**3. Claude Toolkit** 🧰
4 utilities from Microsoft Amplifier:
- **Defensive Utilities**: Parse messy LLM responses (0% → 62.5% success!)
- **Parallel Worktrees**: Test JWT vs OAuth simultaneously
- **Transcripts**: Auto-save before compaction
- **Knowledge Base**: Query docs instantly

**4. 35 Specialized Agents** 🤖
Pre-configured for:
- Development, Testing, Architecture
- Security, Operations, Design
- AI/ML integration, Data engineering

**Results:**
- ✅ 81% size reduction (47,286 → 8,500 chars)
- ✅ 70%+ first-time success rate
- ✅ < 3 iterations average
- ✅ Works with context window tiers (32K → 1M)

**Repository:** https://github.com/Primadetaautomation/claude-config-backup

**License:** MIT (free for commercial use)

**Docs:** Full bilingual (English + Dutch)

**Quick start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Primadetaautomation/claude-config-backup.git
cd your-project
cp ../claude-config-backup/CLAUDE.md .
cp -r ../claude-config-backup/docs .
# Done! Claude reads CLAUDE.md automatically
```

**Who's this for?**
- Anyone using Claude Code professionally
- Teams needing consistent quality
- Devs fighting context limits
- People tired of repeating context

**What's your Claude Code pain point?** I'd love feedback on what else to add!

---

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the response! Some FAQs:

**Q: Does this work with Claude.ai or just Claude Code?**
A: Designed for Claude Code CLI, but the CLAUDE.md standards work with any Claude interface.

**Q: Why not just use system prompts?**
A: This is designed for project-level config that persists across sessions and auto-loads context on demand.

**Q: Can I customize it?**
A: Absolutely! MIT licensed. Fork it, modify the rules, add your own agents. That's the point!

**Q: Do I need all 35 agents?**
A: Nope! Start with the core framework. Add agents as needed. They're optional but useful.

**Q: Any tutorials coming?**
A: Working on it! For now, the README has step-by-step setup. Very straightforward.

Show HN: Production-ready Claude Code configuration (framework + toolkit + 35 agents)

After 6 months refining Claude Code across production projects, I'm open-sourcing my complete configuration system.

**Core problem:** Claude Code is powerful but needs consistent context, standards, and workflows to ship production-ready code efficiently.

**What I built:**

1. **Intent-Based Context Loading**
   - Say "users should login" → Auto-loads security.md + backend.md
   - No technical jargon needed
   - 5 specialized doc modules

2. **CLAUDE Framework**
   - Production standards (TDD, security, error handling)
   - Impact analysis before every code change
   - 80%+ test coverage enforced
   - 70%+ first-time success rate

3. **Claude Toolkit** (utilities from Microsoft Amplifier)
   - Defensive LLM parsing (0% → 62.5% success)
   - Parallel git worktrees
   - Auto-save transcripts
   - Knowledge base queries

4. **35 Pre-configured Agents**
   - senior-fullstack-developer, qa-testing-engineer, security-specialist
   - solutions-architect, devops-deployment-engineer
   - ml-ai-integration, accessibility-specialist, etc.

**Results:**
- 81% config size reduction (47,286 → 8,500 chars)
- < 3 iterations per feature (was 5+)
- First-time success 70%+ (was ~40%)

**Tech:**
- MIT License
- Markdown-based (CLAUDE.md + 5 specialized docs)
- Python toolkit (pip installable)
- Bash utilities (Makefile integration)
- Chrome DevTools MCP integration
- Full bilingual docs (EN + NL)

Repository: https://github.com/Primadetaautomation/claude-config-backup

Designed for solo devs, teams, and agencies. Works with Claude Code v5.0's context window tiers (32K → 1M tokens).

Feedback and contributions welcome!

# 🚀 How I Transformed Claude Code into a Production Powerhouse

*And why I'm open-sourcing everything*

After spending 6 months building production apps with Claude Code, I hit a wall: my configuration file was 47,286 characters - 7,286 characters OVER the 40K limit.

But the real problem wasn't the size. It was this:

**Every conversation, I had to:**
- Re-explain the project structure
- Repeat coding standards
- Specify security requirements
- Define acceptance criteria
- Remind Claude about testing

Sound familiar?

I decided to fix this properly. The result? **A complete configuration system that:**

✅ Reduced config from 47,286 → 8,500 characters (81% reduction)
✅ Increased first-time success from ~40% → 70%+
✅ Cut iterations per feature from 5+ → less than 3
✅ Made plain language work ("users should login" vs "RESTful JWT auth endpoint")

**Today, I'm open-sourcing everything:**
- 🎯 The CLAUDE Framework (production-ready standards)
- 🧰 Claude Toolkit (4 battle-tested utilities)
- 🤖 35 specialized agents
- 📖 Complete bilingual documentation

Repository: https://github.com/Primadetaautomation/claude-config-backup

Let me show you how it works...
